### How does Paimon-ey work?

We can know that you are not a bot, and also check your credit rating, credibility and loanability by the data you provided. We use Authenticated Secure Matching Robot (ASMR) to help match up clients and loan companies, building trust between them. 

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology — distributed meaning not kept by one bookkeeper; a ledger is a book of records — where tamperproof records are shared among a group, so that they can form a consensus about a single truth.

This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority. 

Hence, blockchain solutions are sometimes synonymous with the term “decentralised applications” even though decentralisation is not the only nor the key benefit.
