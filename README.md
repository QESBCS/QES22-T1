# App Background

### What is Paimon-ey?

Paimon-ey is a cross-platform software that helps the client match up with a suitable loan company with the real-time function. We are aimed to build trust between the loan companies and the clients without privacy intrusion.

### Why it is called “Paimon-ey”?

One of the creators loves the character Paimon in a game called Genshin Impact. The project is about loans, which is about money. When we think of our project name, we have no idea what we should name it. So we combined the word “Paimon” and “money” and gets “Paimon-ey” randomly. The original plan is to take this as our temporary name, but as no one cares about changing the project name nor does anyone has a better idea, we deal with it and let it stay for some reason.

# Systems

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology, data are not kept by one bookkeeper but by many. Tamperproof records are shared among a group of stakeholders so that they can form a consensus about the same data, this is what we called “single truth”.

This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority. 

### What is encryption?

Encryption is **a means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information**. The encryption process translates information using an algorithm that makes the original information unreadable.

Encryption by itself does not prevent the interception of information transmissions, but encryption prevents the interceptor from understanding its content. So we can avoid leakage of your privacy.

### Advanced information update

Encryption is **a means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information**. The encryption process translates information using an algorithm that makes the original information unreadable.
