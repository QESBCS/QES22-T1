### What is Paimon-ey?

Paimon-ey is a mobile app which helps the client match up with a suitable loan company with the real-time quote function. We are aimed to build the trust between the loan companies and the clients without privacy intrusion.

### How does Paimon-ey work?

We calculate your credit rating by the data you provided and find out your credibility and loanability. We then show your credit rating to all our partnered loan companies, the number only. We use Authenticated Secure Matching Robot (ASMR) to help match up clients and loan companies, building trust between them. 

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology, data are not kept by one bookkeeper but by many. Tamperproof records are shared among a group of stakeholders so that they can form a consensus about the same data, this is what we called “single truth”.

This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority.
