# App Background

### What is Paimon-ey?

Paimon-ey is a cross-platform software which helps the client match up with a suitable loan company with the real-time quote function. We are aimed to build trust between the loan companies and the clients without privacy intrusion.

### Why it is called “Paimon-ey”?

One of the creators loves the character Paimon in a game called Genshin Impact. The project is about loans, which is about money. When we think of our project name, we have no idea what we should name it. So we combined the word “Paimon” and “money” and gets “Paimon-ey” randomly. The original plan is to take this as our temporary name, but as no one cares about changing the project name nor does anyone has a better idea, we deal with it and let it stay for some reason.

### Who are the founders of Paimon-ey?

Oscar Yeung Yu Hei

Tony To Chun Kit

### How does Paimon-ey work?

We calculate your credit rating by the data you provided and find out your credibility and loanability. We then show your credit rating to all our partnered loan companies, the number only. We use Authenticated Secure Matching Robot (ASMR) to help match up clients and loan companies, building trust between them. 

### Why I should use Paimon-ey?

As a client, we provide free matching up service to save your time. By only showing your credit rating to our partnered loan companies, there isn’t privacy intrusion or unnecessary disclosure of your privacy.

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology, data are not kept by one bookkeeper but by many. Tamperproof records are shared among a group of stakeholders so that they can form a consensus about the same data, this is what we called “single truth”.

This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority.
